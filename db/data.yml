    - Grow your business online
    - "Amazingly, around 60 percent of SMEs are yet to have a convincing presence online so here are some thoughts to help you to build and grow your business online.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      With millions of consumers daily searching online for products or using the internet to research a business before making a buying decision, how can any business afford not to have an online shop front?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      An online business, rather than just a website, allows you to sell products online, communicate with your customers, promote what\xE2\x80\x99s happening in your business and instantly view and measure all the results.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Technology advances now allow you to build secure zones within your site that only staff or VIP customers can access, special pricing and discounts throughout your e-shop and even forums where your customers can comment and discuss your products.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Don't forget to budget for some online promotion; after all, what good is an online business that nobody knows about? Google AdWords is a good place to start. Choose some common keywords that potential customers would use when searching for your products online, set your daily budget and sit back and watch your site visits increase. Want to know more then please contact us With Imagination. "

    - Consumer Power Online
    - "As large and small retailers alike brace themselves for the impact of the financial downturn, some are finding unexpected success through their internet strategy.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      In the lead up to Christmas last year, online traffic nearly doubled over the previous year as customers carried out research, sourced suppliers and made purchases online. Traffic to pricing comparison site, GetPrice.com.au almost tripled from November 2007 to November 2008, while eWay, Australia\xE2\x80\x99s major payment gateway, recorded a 69 percent increase in transaction volumes.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      While the internet offers clear benefits when it comes to shopping for gifts, who would have thought so many people would shop online for fresh food?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The Domino Effect\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Take the case of fast food retailer, Domino\xE2\x80\x99s Pizza, which floored financial analysts in the UK by reporting healthy growth in both revenues and profits \xE2\x80\x94 despite the economic downturn and a reduction in spending on luxuries by cash-strapped consumers.\r\n\
      Last year the UK operation of Domino\xE2\x80\x99s sold \xC2\xA325.3 million worth of pizza via its web activities which now account for over a fifth of delivered pizzas sold in the UK and typically generate an above-average order value.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      This should be food for thought for any retailer or service provider not currently harnessing the internet to display or sell its wares, no matter how small the business.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      There are two main reasons for this. One is consumer power. The internet generation has grown up and the average consumer certainly aged 40 or below, will turn to the web before making a new purchase \xE2\x80\x94 even if the actual purchase is then made in a traditional shop or over the phone. The second important driver is that establishing a professional web presence has never been easier or more affordable.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      If you do not have a fully functioning website, your nearest rival probably soon will. Need some help with your website? We\xE2\x80\x99d love to hear from you. "

    - Is your web site working?
    - "The first step in evaluation is to identify what needs to be evaluated. The aspects of your website listed below and accompanying questions provide a starting point in this process. Examine each of the aspects listed and determine if it applies to your website and whether it should be subject to evaluation. This list is not complete but it should some food for thought.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Strategic issues: How else can we use the Internet to improve profitability?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Management: Do we have an up-to-date and appropriate website strategy, policy and procedures? Are we using email responsibly?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Content and features of the website: Is the quality and scope of content and its maintenance as good as it could be?\r\n\

      \r\n\
      Efficiencies and cost savings: How else can the Internet be used to cut business costs?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Marketing and promotion: Are we doing enough to promote our Internet services? How could we do it better? Are we using it effectively enough to manage customer relationships? Are we using targeted email correctly and avoiding spamming?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Supplier/distributor management: How can our use of the Internet improve the way we manage our suppliers/distributors?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Distribution: How else can we use the Internet to help distribute our services and products?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Budget: Is the e-business operating to budget?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Competitors: What are our competitors doing online and what can we learn from it?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Resources: Is sufficient time and money allocated to maintaining our e-business?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Website usability: Is our website easy to use? Does it make it easy for people to do business with us?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Technical issues: Is the website speed and reliability appropriate, and our connection to the Internet fast enough?\r\n\

    - Consumers use the internet to decide what to buy
    - "Over the past six months, how have you altered your spending habits?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Have you put off purchasing until the economic climate seems more positive or are you just more focused on finding the best deal? Whatever the financial state of the nation, research shows Australians are still spending.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      In fact, retail sales are up 6 per cent compared with the same time last year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. With retail sales rising for the third consecutive month, the sector is showing positive signs of resilience.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      While spending remains strong, other crucial consumer behaviours are strengthening, too. The fact is that today's prudent shoppers are researching their purchases more widely than ever before. Indeed, consumers are searching online and making their purchasing decision long before they enter the physical store.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Online is playing an increasing role in shoppers' decision-making process. Great television commercials inspire consumers to search for more information online. As shoppers consider their potential purchases, compare brands, features and even colours, they use online sources to guide them. "

    - Websites playing a greater role
    - "As the internet continues to adapt, reaching more people in more ways than ever before, your website will play a bigger role in your overall success. As a company or business owner, how can you be sure you\xE2\x80\x99re making the most of your website?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      It\xE2\x80\x99s a first point of call: the most easily accessed medium through which your business and potential customers can connect. But, beyond a great first impression, what should your website be? And, in 2009, what can you do to take it to the next level?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      There\xE2\x80\x99s no time like the present to assess the effectiveness of your current website and there\xE2\x80\x99s one hard and fast rule to keep in mind. If you\xE2\x80\x99ve lost interest, then so have your customers! You see forgotten sites everyday. They\xE2\x80\x99re rarely if ever updated. If they have a blog, its first and last post was January 2006. Don\xE2\x80\x99t allow your website be one of these. They create the impression that the whole business is stagnant, and far from promoting a company or brand, they may actually do it damage.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Remember, the overall aim is to make your website an easy, intuitive and friendly experience, at all times driven by the customer. The popularity of a business\xE2\x80\x99 website is usually a good thermometer for popularity of the business itself, so make a plan in 2009: get back to the web and put your business out there.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      <b>Top five tips</b>\r\n\
      1. Move away from \xE2\x80\x98static\xE2\x80\x99 and towards \xE2\x80\x98social\xE2\x80\x99\r\n\
      2. Give your customers the site they want\r\n\
      3. Develop in phases, not all at once\r\n\
      4. Invest the time to keep your content updated\r\n\
      5. Promote your site and put it at the centre of your brand\r\n\
      Do you need some help with your website? We\xE2\x80\x99d love to hear from you. "

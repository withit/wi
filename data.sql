Traffic to pricing comparison site, GetPrice.com.au almost tripled from November 2007 to November 2008, while eWay, Australia’s major payment gateway, recorded a 69 percent increase in transaction volumes.\r\n\r\nWhile the internet offers clear benefits when it comes to shopping for gifts, who would have thought so many people would shop online for fresh food?\r\n\r\nThe Domino Effect\r\n\r\nTake the case of fast food retailer, Domino’s Pizza, which floored financial analysts in the UK by reporting healthy growth in both revenues and profits — despite the economic downturn and a reduction in spending on luxuries by cash-strapped consumers.\r\nLast year the UK operation of Domino’s sold £25.3 million worth of pizza via its web activities which now account for over a fifth of delivered pizzas sold in the UK and typically generate an above-average order value.\r\n\r\nThis should be food for thought for any retailer or service provider not currently harnessing the internet to display or sell its wares, no matter how small the business.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons for this. One is consumer power. The internet generation has grown up and the average consumer certainly aged 40 or below, will turn to the web before making a new purchase — even if the actual purchase is then made in a traditional shop or over the phone. The second important driver is that establishing a professional web presence has never been easier or more affordable.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have a fully functioning website, your nearest rival probably soon will.

Whatever the financial state of the nation, research shows Australians are still spending.\r\n\r\nIn fact, retail sales are up 6 per cent compared with the same time last year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. With retail sales rising for the third consecutive month, the sector is showing positive signs of resilience.\r\n\r\nWhile spending remains strong, other crucial consumer behaviours are strengthening, too. The fact is that today\'s prudent shoppers are researching their purchases more widely than ever before. Indeed, consumers are searching online and making their purchasing decision long before they enter the physical store.\r\n\r\nOnline is playing an increasing role in shoppers\' decision-making process. Great television commercials inspire consumers to search for more information online. As shoppers consider their potential purchases, compare brands, features and even colours, they use online sources to guide them.

As a company or business owner, how can you be sure you’re making the most of your website?\r\n\r\nIt’s a first point of call: the most easily accessed medium through which your business and potential customers can connect. But, beyond a great first impression, what should your website be? And, in 2009, what can you do to take it to the next level?\r\n\r\nThere’s no time like the present to assess the effectiveness of your current website and there’s one hard and fast rule to keep in mind. If you’ve lost interest, then so have your customers! You see forgotten sites everyday. They’re rarely if ever updated. If they have a blog, its first and last post was January 2006. Don’t allow your website be one of these. They create the impression that the whole business is stagnant, and far from promoting a company or brand, they may actually do it damage.\r\n\r\nRemember, the overall aim is to make your website an easy, intuitive and friendly experience, at all times driven by the customer. The popularity of a business’ website is usually a good thermometer for popularity of the business itself, so make a plan in 2009: get back to the web and put your business out there.\r\n\r\n<b>Top five tips</b>\r\n1. Move away from ‘static’ and towards ‘social’\r\n2. Give your customers the site they want\r\n3. Develop in phases, not all at once\r\n4. Invest the time to keep your content updated\r\n5.

From blogs to forums, web based features and mobile applications, there are a daunting number of directions in which to head. \r\n\r\nYour imagination is the limit however, you’ll probably soon hit on questions of budget. Luckily, one of the key points is to realise that a large investment, which brings huge changes to your site in one swoop, isn’t actually the only way to go.\r\n\r\nInstead, a process that involves incremental changes, features and functions driven by user demand, is the most effective course. Developing in phases allows you to listen to and assess customer feedback before you act on the next step.\r\n \r\nIn order to help achieve this With Imagination uses Google Analytics on all our client websites. Google Analytics provides an excellent free source of information to help understand how the site is being used and the success of its content. \r\n\r\nThis strategy makes your website much more agile. This is terrifically important because making the best move at the best time is crucial in such a fast changing space.\r\n\r\nBefore embarking on your developments, however, you need to make sure the foundations that you’re building on are solid. You need to have a good ‘usability design’ and a design style that attracts your core target market.\r\n\r\nSpend some time thinking about your website target market and try to understand their level of internet experience and what features they would be looking for on your site.\r\n \r\nOne of the most common mistakes we see, particularly by small businesses is basing their website design on what they – or their agency – believe it should look like.    \r\n   \r\nIn our experience, this can actually result in a negative ROI; that is, a website with a ‘look and feel’ that serves the needs of the web designer, or which satisfies the desires of business owner, and not the customer, necessitating further investment down the track.\r\n\r\nAlso don\'t forget to consider the latest trends in online activity when designing your website. These are:\r\n\r\n1. Greater one to one communication\r\n2. New interactive/social media on the rise\r\n3. Increasing web marketing activities such as search optimisation, webinars and email campaigns.\r\n\r\nNeed some help with your website design?

Bringing traffic requires time, effort and patience.\r\nI’m a big believer in search engine optimisation (SEO). Good keywords and page headings are essential to be sure that Google, Bing and Yahoo know who and what you are.\r\n\r\nPartnering with other brands and linking between your sites is a great way to increase your page-rank at the same as time driving interested traffic to your site. \r\n\r\nTargeted banner advertising on the sites that your audience generally visits, whether that’s ninemsn, news.com.au, smh.com.au or something much more specific, can help, but in today’s saturated landscape (with its cynical, media-savvy consumers) it can be difficult to stand out.\r\n\r\nUsing Google Adwords is another way to drive traffic to your website. By carefully selecting a few keywords you can cost effectively attract your target market to your website? Adwords reports can also be added directly in your Google Analytics reports to provide comprehensive reporting. \r\n     \r\nWhat’s more effective is often trying to reach your customers in non-traditional ways. Becoming an expert blogger or opinion leader in your industry can help establish a profile.\r\n \r\nOffline, promoting your web address through your packaging, signage, press releases, business cards, vehicles (indeed almost anywhere it will fit!) puts it at the centre of your identity and brand.\r\n\r\nNew and interesting web-based features, especially industry firsts, can also generate buzz for your brand. At the moment, mobile applications such as those for the iPhone are proving hugely popular.

There is no difference between the real life and the digital life, its the same thing.\r\n\r\nDeciding what to do with your marketing budget can be a challenge when a strong return on investment from every dollar you spend is critical. And while it may be hard to see today’s uncertain economic times as a moment of opportunity, the good news is that marketers have something at hand which they didn’t during past downturns: the web.\r\n\r\nThe internet has changed the way we socialise, do business and get information; it is also fundamentally changing the way we shop. There is no slowdown in consumers’ adoption of the digital world.\r\n\r\nToday, online is where the customers are. According to ACNielsen, almost 92 percent of Australians have home internet access, and 34 percent are online at work. Australians now spend more time on the internet than on any other medium—an average of 16.1 hours each week, followed by 12.9 hours watching TV and 8.8 hours listening to the radio.\r\n\r\nAccording to ACNielsen, more than 11.9 million Australians use Google each month and almost three quarters of Australian internet users shop online. e-Marketer (US based online marketing company) forecasts annual online sales of more than $31 billion nationally by 2011. \r\n\r\nThis change in consumer behaviour represents an opportunity for growth for most marketers, so it makes sense to move your marketing budget accordingly.    \r\n\r\nNeed some help with your emarketing activities?

Search will get more social in several ways: by including real-time content in results.\r\n\r\n• Video: Further support for video ad growth will come from sites that offer a deeper catalog of professional video content—such as whole seasons of TV shows (both present and past), exclusives of entire sports events and other premium content. \r\n\r\n• Ad Targeting and Privacy: In 2010, we will see more Websites let users know what data is being kept about them and give them options to remove data or prevent it from being accumulated. That means publishers will also increasingly need to make clear what the trade-offs are for accepting online advertising—the free content, the quality of the content, the basic value exchange.\r\n\r\n• Search: By using social data to filter search queries, search engines will hope to deliver even more relevant results and more effective advertising. Another key change to speed up in 2010 will be more video results as part of general search queries. \r\n\r\n• Mobile: Mobile ad spending will rise from USD$416 million in 2009 to USD$593 million in 2010 as more brands and agencies integrate mobile into their marketing mix. The fusion of mobile and social and the appetite for apps (among both consumers and brands) will continue unabated. \r\n\r\n• Twitter: The revenue streams that have been discussed include paid corporate accounts, celebrity authentication and temporal search. Expect Twitter to roll this out in 2010 as the cornerstone of its temporal search business.\r\n\r\n• Online News Content: Consumers will resist paid systems, and competitors will capitalize on the negative sentiment with ad-supported content. In the end, there will be islands of paid content (The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times) and hybrids of paid and ad-supported models, but on the whole, the digital media landscape will be predominantly ad-based.\r\n\r\n• Digital Video Convergence: TVs with direct Internet connectivity, or with on-screen access to content portals such as YouTube, Blockbuster and Netflix. As online video becomes intertwined with the living-room TV experience, download and streaming services will take on a prominent role in the home entertainment ecosystem.\r\n\r\n• E-Commerce: Mobile-commerce’s time has arrived, and it is an easy bet that sales in 2010 will pass the USD$1 billion mark. In 2010, retailers will become more serious about trying to measure social media’s impact on sales. One question retailers will grapple with is how much a large fan base translates into sales or brand loyalty.\r\n\r\nSource: Posted: December 17, 2009.

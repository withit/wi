                <h1>Get More Website Traffic: How to optimize your site for search engines</h1><br />
                <p><h2>Web traffic is the amount of data sent and received by visitors to a web site. 
                It is a large portion of Internet traffic. This is determined by the number of visitors and the number of pages they visit. 
                Sites monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic to see which parts or pages of their site are popular and if there are any apparent trends, 
                such as one specific page being viewed mostly by people in a particular country. 
                There are many ways to monitor this traffic and the gathered data is used to help structure sites, 
                highlight security problems or indicate a potential lack of bandwidth â€” not all web traffic is welcome.<br /><br />

				Some companies offer advertising schemes that, in return for increased web traffic (visitors), 
                pay for screen space on the site. Sites also often aim to increase their web traffic through inclusion on search engines and through Search engine optimization.
                <br /><br /><br />

				<b>Increase web site traffic</b><br /><br />
				Web traffic can be increased by placement of a site in search engines and purchase of advertising, 
                including bulk e-mail, pop-up ads, and in-page advertisements. Web traffic can also be increased by purchasing non-internet based advertising.<br /><br />

				If a web page is not listed in the first pages of any search, the odds of someone finding it diminishes greatly 
                (especially if there is other competition on the first page). 
				Very few people go past the first page, and the percentage that go to subsequent pages is substantially lower. 
				Consequently, getting proper placement on search engines is as important as the web site itself.<br /><br />

				There are a number of other things you can do to increase your web traffic, 
				including but not limited to building link popularity, webrings, offering free e-books or articles and classified advertisements.<br /><br />

				Of the above mentioned items, perhaps the easiest one to do is building link popularity. 
				This can be accomplished by writing e-mails to sites similar to yours and asking if they would link to your site. 
				The second way of increasing your web traffic is writing to e-zines or to free article sites. 
				There are many sites which will accept your written material, the catch is that you are giving it away for free. 
				The benefit, however, is that you get to include a link to your site in the article, meaning every time someone clicks on your link, 
				it brings free traffic to your site. Pixel ads can bring traffic to your site but usually will not get you a targeted audience.

              <h1>Position Design as a Strategic Business Element</h1><br />
              <p><h2><em>"Recognizing the importance of design is a corporation's first step to creating great design. The second step is talking to good designers immediately."</em> 
              - Joe Mansueto, President Morningstar<br /><br />

				The Gap, Herman Miller, Morningstar, and others that use graphic design as a strategic business tool, 
                take advantage of an obvious, but nonetheless often ignored fact. Things that people see affect them.<br /><br />

				Every physical representation of a company's image that people notice, whether it's a letter written on the corporate stationery, a product and its packaging, 
                a brochure or annual report, a logo in an ad, a sign, graphics on a vehicle, or a name badge worn by a counter clerk, offers an opportunity to win respect and admiration. 
                And business can successfully shape favorable consumer opinion by intelligently controlling these many forms of their communication program.<br /><br />

				In today's message-saturated environment, communication programs that produce positive results must stand out in order to get noticed. 
                Thanks to the successful use of graphic design by professional sports teams, manufacturers from Harley Davidson to Kodak, and Hollywood from Disney to Warner Brothers, 
                people have become graphic design sophisticates. The age 20-somethings especially, have been brought up on TV, computer games, and brand name everything, 
                respond only to high quality design. That's why successful companies hire graphic designers to plan and produce business communications. 
                They realize that they need professionals to help them figure out which message to send out and how to deliver it with effective impact.<br /><br />

				Strategically guided graphic design positions an organization to set off a very desirable chain reaction: 
                Positive impressions create higher perceived value which boosts sales. 
                The final links in the chain tug nicely on the bottom line because the first links are forged into place with a results-oriented plan - a communication strategy.</h2>
